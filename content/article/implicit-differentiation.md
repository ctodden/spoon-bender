# Implicit differentiation

The graph of the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ is the circle of radius $5$ centered at the origin. This graph, of course, fails the vertical line test, and therefore fails to define $y$ explicitly as a function of $x$. It is not hard to see, however, that there _are_ two explicit functions lurking about --- namely, the functions defined by the top and bottom halves of the graph.
