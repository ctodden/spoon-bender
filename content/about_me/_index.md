## About me

I first taught mathematics at [Phillips Academy](https://www.andover.edu) in 1990 as a teaching fellow right out of college. After one more year at Andover, I studied math at Duke University and earned a PhD in 1997. After teaching at Amherst College for four years, I returned to Andover in 2001.

When I have the time I still like to think about the [universal hyperbolic solenoid](http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2005-357-05/S0002-9947-04-03472-5/). 

Enjoy the site --- I hope it helps you learn some calculus! Please contact me if you have comments or suggestions. (I have a gmail.com address using the name ctodden.)
