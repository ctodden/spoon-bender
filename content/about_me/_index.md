## About me

I first taught mathematics at [Phillips Academy](https://www.andover.edu) in 1990 as a teaching fellow right out of college. I stayed at Andover for another year, then moved on to study math at Duke University, earning a PhD in 1997. After a four-year stretch teaching at Amherst College, I returned to Andover in 2001.

When I have the time I still like to think about the [universal hyperbolic solenoid](http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2005-357-05/S0002-9947-04-03472-5/). 

Enjoy the site --- I hope it helps you learn some calculus! Please contact me if you have comments or suggestions. (I have a gmail.com address using the name ctodden.)
